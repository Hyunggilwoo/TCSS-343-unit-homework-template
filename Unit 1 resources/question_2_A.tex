\section{2.A}
    Alice has noticed that there is a pattern appearing in some of the summations she has been working on:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\sum_{i=1}^{n}i \in \Theta\left(n^2\right)$
\item $\sum_{i=1}^{n}i^2 \in \Theta\left(n^3\right)$
\item $\sum_{i=1}^{n}i^{\frac{1}{2}} \in \Theta\left(n^{\frac{3}{2}}\right)$
\end{itemize}

Help her by stating a good guess for a Theta bound on this summation for any $d>0$.
\[
\sum_{i=1}^ni^d
\]
