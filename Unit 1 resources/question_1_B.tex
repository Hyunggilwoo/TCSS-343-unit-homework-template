\section{1.B}

    Now Alice asks you to place the functions in order of asymptotic growth from the slowest growing to the fastest growing. (Remember an algorithm with a \textit{fast} growing run time function is a \textit{slow} algorithm and vice versa. It is easy to confuse these when classifying functions.) You do not need to provide proofs in this step, but you may want to use the limit test or algebra to compare your functions.
