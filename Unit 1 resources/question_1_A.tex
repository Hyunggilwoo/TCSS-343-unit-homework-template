\section{1.A}
    Alice has asked you to help her classify these functions based on their asymptotic growth rate. That is, she wants you to prove a tight big-Theta bound for each function by following these steps.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Use algebra to simply the function for ease of analysis. Remember the goal of simplification is to isolate terms and identify the dominant term. For instance, we might want to expand $(n+1)^2$ to $n^2 +2n +1$ to see that $n^2$ is the dominant term.
        
        \item Use your intuition, the limit test, or algebra to come up with a good guess of a tight bound. For instance, after isolating $n^2$ as the dominant term we might guess our polynomial is in $\Theta(n^2)$.
        
        \item Use the limit test or the definitions to prove that your guess is correct. Both methods can provide correct proofs, and its a good idea to practice both methods. Sometimes our guess is incorrect and we need to return to the previous step.
        
    \end{enumerate}
